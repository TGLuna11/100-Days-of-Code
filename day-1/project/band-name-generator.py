# Final project for day 1: Band Name Generator
# This project is a simple band name generator that asks the user for the city they grew up in and the name of their pet.
# It then combines the two to give a band name.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")
city = input("What city did you grow up in?\n")
pets_name = input("What is your pet's name?\n")

print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pets_name)
